A library for subtitle-based GIF-generating reddit bots

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A functioning installation of PostgreSQL is required. If you don't have it installed, `psycopg2` will fail to install.

### Installation

Pull down the source code and run `python setup.py install` to install the library directly. You can also run `python setup.py sdist` to generate a `.tar.gz` source distribution and install that in the environment you wish.
